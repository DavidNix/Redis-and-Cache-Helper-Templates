# Redis and Cache Templates for Rails

## Redis Helper
A service object that functions as a main point of interacting with Redis.

### Advantages
* Does not use a global variable for interaction with redis.
* Uses a connection pool to cache connections.

### Setup
1. Add this to your gemfile and run bundle install:

    gem 'hiredis'
    gem 'redis', '~> 3.0.1', :require => ["redis/connection/hiredis", "redis"]
    gem 'connection_pool', '~> 1.0.0'

2. Edit environment variable in redis_helper.rb to point to your correct redis url.
3. Add redis_init.rb to your config/initializers.
4. I suggest adding redis_helper.rb to app/services.  If not, you need to include it somewhere in application.rb, on a class by class basis, or in any folder that gets autoloaded.

To test on local environments, I suggest using homebrew to install redis locally.

### Usage
Use the block syntax:
    RedisHelper.with_connection do |connection|
        connection.get("some_key")
    end

Or use the simpler syntax:
    RedisHelper.get("some_key")
