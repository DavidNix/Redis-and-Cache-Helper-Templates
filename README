# Redis and Cache Templates for Rails

## Redis Helper
A service object that functions a main point of interacting with Redis.

### Advantages
* Does not use a global variable for interaction with redis.
* Uses a connection pool to cache connections.

### Setup

1. Add this to your gemfile and run bundle install:

    gem 'hiredis'
    gem 'redis', '~> 3.0.1', :require => ["redis/connection/hiredis", "redis"]
    gem 'connection_pool', '~> 1.0.0'

2. Edit redis_helper.rb environment variable to point to your correct redis url.
3. Add redis_init.rb to your config/initializers.

To test on local environments, I suggest using homebrew to install redis locally.
